The flashcard-app was honestly born because I needed to brush up on my coding skills! The reason I chose flashcards specifically is because a lot of my non-CS research/work relates to education and the art of learning.
Alisha's notes: self-explanatory, it is my digital notebook (ish) for updates I dream of making once I learn how! I plan on using this as a dummy project to experiment with different ideas.

The app is a basic flashcard app where you can select a deck (or make a new one!) and flip the card to either term/answer. If you're feeling bold or would like a self-confidence boost, you can quiz yourself test-style and get the results at the end. For the more whimsical, there's a memory-match game to disrupt from the monotonous pattern of term-definition.

With an actual user base, I hope for it to become a place where students can publish public decks (hence the 'trending-decks' framework) for others to use. Once I learn more tools for AI recommendation systems, I think it would be a great addition to make!

My project had a bit of a linear progression, where I was just planning to make a simple flashcard app and then started adding more features once ideas struck. My biggest struggle was honestly remembering a lot of the best practices and syntax, so I scoured a lot of reddit programming threads & stack overflow to get a good foundation to build my project on. I learned a lot of HTML/CSS tricks and methods that I didn't use in this app, but I am glad I have the knowledge in my toolkit.
